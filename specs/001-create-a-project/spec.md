# Feature Specification: Query Engine Performance Comparison Project

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-project`  
**Created**: September 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a project to compare performance of quey engines: duckdb, daft, starrocks. The project will enable users to run a benchmark script, this script will execute same query on iceberg table(use hive metastore as catalog). Output will be a comparison about execution time, memory usage of each engine. Noted that the iceberg infra are already exist, do setup it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Query engine benchmarking project
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: data engineers, performance analysts
   ‚Üí Actions: run benchmarks, compare engines, measure performance
   ‚Üí Data: iceberg tables via hive metastore
   ‚Üí Constraints: existing infrastructure, three specific engines
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what types of queries should be benchmarked?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what output format for comparison results?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: run script ‚Üí get performance comparison
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Data engineers and performance analysts need to objectively compare the performance characteristics of three query engines (DuckDB, Daft, StarRocks) when executing queries against Iceberg tables. They want to run a standardized benchmark script that measures execution time and memory usage for identical queries across all three engines, producing a clear comparison report to inform technology selection decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing Iceberg infrastructure with Hive Metastore catalog, **When** a user runs the benchmark script, **Then** the system executes identical queries on all three engines and captures performance metrics
2. **Given** completed benchmark execution, **When** the script finishes, **Then** the system outputs a comparison report showing execution time and memory usage for each engine
3. **Given** multiple benchmark runs, **When** a user wants to track performance trends, **Then** the system provides consistent and reproducible results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when one engine fails to execute a query while others succeed?
- How does the system handle memory limitations during benchmarking?
- What occurs if the Hive Metastore connection is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute identical queries on DuckDB, Daft, and StarRocks engines
- **FR-002**: System MUST measure execution time for each query on each engine
- **FR-003**: System MUST measure memory usage for each query on each engine
- **FR-004**: System MUST connect to existing Iceberg tables via Hive Metastore catalog
- **FR-005**: System MUST output performance comparison results in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format not specified - CSV, JSON, HTML report?]
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to run benchmarks via a single script execution
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle engine-specific connection and query execution
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what level of query customization - predefined queries only, or user-provided queries?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure fair comparison by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: warm-up runs, multiple iterations, or single execution?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate successful query execution before recording metrics

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Benchmark Run**: Represents a complete performance test session across all engines with timestamp and configuration
- **Query**: SQL statement to be executed against Iceberg tables, with identifier and complexity metadata
- **Engine Result**: Performance metrics (execution time, memory usage) for a specific query on a specific engine
- **Performance Report**: Aggregated comparison showing relative performance across all engines and queries
- **Iceberg Table**: Data source accessed via Hive Metastore catalog, with schema and partition information
