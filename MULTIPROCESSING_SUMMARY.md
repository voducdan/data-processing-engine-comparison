# Multiprocessing Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Multiprocessing Support**
- Added `import multiprocessing as mp` and `import pickle` to `benchmark.py`
- Added `mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)` in main section for cross-platform compatibility

### 2. **Created New Function: `run_single_engine_benchmark()`**
- Standalone function that can run a single engine benchmark in a separate process
- Takes engine name, connection parameters, and iteration count as arguments
- Returns serializable dictionary with results and aggregated statistics
- Handles errors gracefully and returns structured error information

### 3. **Enhanced `run_benchmark()` Method**
- Added `use_multiprocessing` parameter (default: True)
- **Multiprocessing Mode**: Uses `multiprocessing.Pool` to run engines in parallel
- **Sequential Mode**: Fallback option for debugging
- Timeout protection (10 minutes per engine)
- Proper result collection and aggregation from separate processes

### 4. **Key Features**
- **Process Isolation**: Each engine runs in its own process
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple engines can run simultaneously
- **Fault Tolerance**: Engine failures don't affect other engines
- **Memory Accuracy**: True memory measurement without cross-contamination
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents hanging processes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of process failures and timeouts

### 5. **Updated Documentation**
- Enhanced README.md with multiprocessing architecture details
- Added usage examples for both multiprocessing and sequential modes
- Documented performance benefits and debugging options

## Benefits

1. **Better Isolation**: Each engine runs independently without affecting others
2. **Accurate Memory Measurement**: No memory leaks between engines
3. **Fault Tolerance**: One engine crash doesn't stop the entire benchmark
4. **Parallel Execution**: Reduced total runtime when multiple CPU cores available
5. **Debugging Support**: Option to run sequentially for troubleshooting

## Usage

```python
# Default multiprocessing mode
benchmark = PerformanceBenchmark(uri, table, query)
results = benchmark.run_benchmark()

# Sequential mode for debugging
results = benchmark.run_benchmark(use_multiprocessing=False)
```

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding robust multiprocessing support for better performance measurement and reliability.
