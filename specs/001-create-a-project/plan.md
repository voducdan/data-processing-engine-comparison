# Implementation Plan: Query Engine Performance Comparison Project

**Branch**: `001-create-a-project` | **Date**: September 23, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-a-project/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A Python-based benchmark system that executes identical queries on DuckDB, Daft, and StarRocks engines against Iceberg tables via Hive Metastore, measuring execution time and memory usage to produce performance comparisons. Implementation uses Python with uv for dependency management, focusing on simplicity with a single script approach.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: PyIceberg, DuckDB, Daft, StarRocks Python connectors, pyarrow, psutil  
**Storage**: Iceberg tables via Hive Metastore (existing infrastructure)  
**Testing**: pytest  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS development environment  
**Project Type**: single - simple benchmark script  
**Performance Goals**: Accurate measurement of query execution time and memory usage  
**Constraints**: Must use existing Iceberg infrastructure, no setup required for Iceberg/Hive  
**Scale/Scope**: Single script, 3 engines, standardized query benchmarking

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: Constitution file appears to be a template - proceeding with standard software engineering principles:
- **Simplicity**: ✅ Single script approach minimizes complexity
- **Testability**: ✅ Clear separation of concerns for each engine
- **Maintainability**: ✅ Modular design for easy engine addition/removal
- **Reliability**: ✅ Error handling for engine failures and infrastructure issues

No constitutional violations identified - proceeding with simple, focused approach.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Simple benchmark script with modular engine implementations

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- **Project Setup Tasks**: UV configuration, dependency installation, directory structure
- **Core Infrastructure Tasks**: Base engine interface, configuration management, CLI argument parsing
- **Engine Implementation Tasks**: DuckDB, Daft, StarRocks engine implementations [P]
- **Measurement Tasks**: Performance monitoring, memory tracking, result aggregation
- **Integration Tasks**: End-to-end benchmark execution, error handling
- **Validation Tasks**: Contract tests, quickstart validation, infrastructure connectivity tests

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Setup Phase**: Project structure, dependencies, configuration framework
- **Core Phase**: Base interfaces, measurement infrastructure, CLI framework  
- **Engine Phase**: Parallel engine implementations (DuckDB, Daft, StarRocks) [P]
- **Integration Phase**: Benchmark orchestration, result reporting
- **Testing Phase**: Contract validation, end-to-end testing

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
1. Project setup and dependencies (uv, pyproject.toml)
2. Core abstractions (BaseEngine, BenchmarkConfig, measurement utilities)
3. Engine implementations (3 parallel tasks for each engine) [P]
4. CLI interface and configuration management
5. Result processing and output formatting
6. Integration tests and quickstart validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
